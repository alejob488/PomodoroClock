This project is one of the final projects required to receive the FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Certificate.

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/.
2. Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
3. Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
4. User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
5. User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
6. User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
7. Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
8. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
